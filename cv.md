3. Summary:
   My name is Anna Linnik, I come from Minsk, but I have been living and studying in Italy from 2017. I am a native Russian and Belarusian speaker, and I speak fluently Italian and have a good level of English. I am passionate about languages. Therefore, my academic history is related to this discipline. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in philology obtained at the Belarusian State University in 2017, and I am studying Cultural mediation at the University of Milan.
   I worked as an assistant at the university department. In addition, I worked time as interpreter for italian businessmen. In Italy I worked for more than one year as a seller.
   I like being in contact with persons and help them find what they want.
   As for my personal qualities I am a responsible, well-focused and fast learning person. Sometimes I am too perfectionist.
   My main hobby is photography.
   Recently I realized that I want to try my hand in programming. I would like to write a code, but also to design projects. I was started studying HTML and SCC and I liked it. I hope that this course helps me to improve my skills.
